## üßí Explain the Project to a Child
> "Imagine you want to go see a movie with your friends. You open Tickty on your phone or computer. You see pictures of cool movies. You pick one you like. Then, you choose what time you want to go and click on your favorite seat (maybe a VIP seat if you're feeling fancy!). You pay with your card, and ta-da! You get a magical ticket with a special code. When you get to the cinema, they scan your code, and you‚Äôre in! Easy, fun, and no waiting in line."
